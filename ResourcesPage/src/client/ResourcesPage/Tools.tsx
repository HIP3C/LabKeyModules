            <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/immuneregulation" target="_blank">ImmuneRegulation</a>
            <p>
                Web platform that allows you to interactively explore the 
                regulation of genes of interest by querying the regulation 
                in the eQTL, Transcription Factor, and GQAS datasets. 
            </p>
            <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collection_details.jsp#C7" target="_blank">ImmuneSigDB</a> 
            <p>
                A collection of Immune Signatures gene sets that represent cell types, states, 
                and perturbations within the immune system developed by the Haining Lab.  
            </p>
            <a href="https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#" target="_blank">Immcantation</a>
            <p>
                The Immcantation framework provide a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for 
                high-throughput AIRR-seq datasets. Beginning from raw reads, Python and R packages 
                are provided for pre-processing, population structure determination, and repertoire analysis.

            <a href="http://insilico.utulsa.edu/index.php/reliefseq/" target="_blank">ReliefSeq</a>
            <p>
                Machine learning feature selection method for GWAS, RNA-Seq 
                and other high-dimensional data sets able to identify 
                genetic variables that influence continuous or dichotomous 
                outcomes through interactions with other genetic variables.

            <p>
                The Human Immunology Project Consortium aims to identify molecular signatures that correlate
                with the outcomes of vaccinations, adjuvants, or natural infections in humans.  To facilitate
                the dissemination of this information to the scientific community, the Consortium has developed the
                HIPC Dashboard, a web interface that provides access to consistently annotated immune signatures
                generated by HIPC activities as well as curated from the literature.
