# GeneExpressionExplorer

This module can be used to quickly plot the expression level of one or more genes against a selected immunological response variable (e.g. HAI) in one or more cohorts. Visualization is achieved using the [ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) R package. Demographics variables such as gender and age can be added to the plot using aesthetic variables such as color, shape etc. More details can be found by exploring the manual or the source code.
