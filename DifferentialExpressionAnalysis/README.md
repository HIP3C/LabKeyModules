# DifferentialGeneExpressionAnalysis

This module can be used to test for differential gene expression across time (or across a pre-specified contrast) within a specified cohort. It uses the [Limma](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) R package for performing differential expression analysis. More details can be found by exploring the manual or the source code.
